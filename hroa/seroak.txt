Visitors to Sero’ak sometimes joke that the first law the founders of the city passed was a ban on right angles. From Caduceus headquarters in the Orchard of Idun to the humblest cafe in the commercial district, the lines of Sero’ak’s buildings flow seamlessly from one to the next in curves and arches. 
    The Serpens capital is known colloquially as “The City of Reflection,” a name derived from the repeated vertical symmetry found throughout the city’s design. Sero’ak could be argued to actually be two cities: Vasuki, which lies on Hroa’s surface; and it’s mirror Ananta, which hangs suspended from a cavern beneath.
