    Rising up from the heart of Vasuki is the largest structure on Hroa’s surface: The Orchard of Idun. The Orchard serves as the headquarters of Caduceus, the organization for which House Serpens is best known. It connects with the Academy through the crust of the planet. Founded in the early days after humanity’s arrival in Acheron Rho, Caduceus has endured in one form or another for most of the Empire’s history and today is known as the premiere provider of medical care in the sector.
The Orchard itself is a set of six towers, all of which twist around a central open space forming a helix. At ground level between the towers is an enormous garden enclosed in a transparent dome. Every few stories, sky-tunnels from each tower meet at another garden-dome suspended in the space between them, with a final massive dome spanning across the tops of all six towers at the top. The final dome holds something more akin to a small forest than a garden, complete with small mammalian fauna. These gardens are used for a variety of purposes related to the care and treatment of Caduceus patients including physical and mental therapy, meditation and relaxation, and the growing of medicinal herbs.
