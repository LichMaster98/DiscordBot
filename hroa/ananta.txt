While the architecture on the surface of Sero’ak is beautiful to behold and as impressive as any capital in the sector, even it pales to the marvel of engineering beneath. From the ceiling of a massive cavern beneath the city hangs another Sero’ak, a mirror to the one above suspended over an underground sea.  
    There are lifts everywhere, including inside most public buildings, that shuttle people through the crust of the planet to their equivalent spot on the other side. But Sero’ak’s mirror is not perfect, as first-time visitors to the undercity learn with dismay. With no need to protect from Hroa’s hostile atmosphere, the sky-tunnels in the undercity are not enclosed but simply bordered by sturdy railings.  
    While any member of House Serpens could cross these open bridges as easily as their own living room, most tourists do some form of what the natives call “the offworld slink”, a way of walking while clinging tightly to the railing while trying to desperately to appear unafraid.
