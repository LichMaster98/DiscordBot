Suspended from the heart of Ananta is the largest structure beneath Hroa: The Imperial Academy of Psionic Learning and Wellness, better known simply as “The Academy.” The Academy is the oldest and most prestigious center of psionic training and research in all of Acheron Rho, with a history nearly as long as that of it’s sister organization, Caduceus.
    The structure of the Academy is a near perfect mirror of the Orchard of Idun, which lies directly above it and to which it connects through a series of lifts and tunnels. Like the Orchard, the Academy is six towers twisted around a central space. Unlike the Orchard, however, the Academy’s center houses a seventh tower, larger than the others and twisting on its axis.
    Each of the Academy’s outer towers is dedicated to one of the psionic disciplines, biopsionics, metapsionics, precognition, telekinesis, telepathy, and teleportation. The seventh is more general purpose, housing administrative offices, dormitories, training facilities, and labs for research into non-specialized psionic theory.
