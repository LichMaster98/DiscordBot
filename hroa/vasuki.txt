    Throughout the surface city, known as Vasuki, towers are adjoined by transparent sky-tunnels, allowing citizens and visitors to move comfortably without the need for breathers. In the oldest parts of the city, the sky-tunnels mirror the gently curving streets on the ground. Newer construction is far less orderly. Streets meander and take odd turns, single-story shops rub shoulders with looming towers, and the sky-tunnels simply soar over asymmetrical blocks giving no thought to the arrangement of avenues below. Though the old city would appear from above as an orderly series of stacked rings, the new city looks like exactly what itâ€™s grown to be: a tangle of snakes.
