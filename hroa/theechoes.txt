    The cavern which houses Ananta is only the largest  part of an extensive cave network known as The Echoes. Since the Echoes were discovered during the construction of Sero’ak, the people of Hroa have filled the barren caves with life and culture. Some of the larger caverns are home to tiny communities of ten or twenty who make their lives fishing in the Waiting Sea or one of the smaller bodies of water. The Echoes are also the home of the greatest achievements in Hroan culture. When a Hroan artist is recognized as a true master of their craft, no matter the field, they are given funds and time to transform a cave into their magnum opus. These installations, known as Whispers, stand as a testament to each artist’s personal vision and creativity, and will stand for as long as Hroa does.
