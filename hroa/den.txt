   In the shadow of the Orchard of Idun sits the center of Hroa government: The Den of Snakes. The only major building to exist on both sides of Sero’ak, the Den is driven like a spike through Hroa’s surface. The Vasuki Den is a an ovoid bowl centered around an open-air courtyard that is entirely unprotected from the atmosphere. The surrounding building is home to the bureaucracy of planetary government and the Ministra who field complaints of lower nobles. 
    The true heart of Serpens, the Ananta Den, is a fat spiral resembling a coiled snake. It is in it’s dim halls and gloomy conference rooms that the true work of the House happens. Here the High Ministra coordinate diplomacy, Compilers pour over data from agents throughout the sector, and the Oracular Council turns it’s combined will into a singular weapon to pierce the Veil deeper than any individual could hope to.
